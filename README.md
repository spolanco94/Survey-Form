# Pet Adoption Survey Form
## Overview
This project focuses on a Pet Adoption Survey Form designed as a refresher to reinforce basic HTML and CSS skills. The form aims to simulate a real-world application that could be used by pet adoption agencies to collect potential adopters' information.

## Features
* **Responsive Design**: The form is fully responsive, ensuring it's accessible on devices of various sizes.
* **Field Validation**: Basic HTML5 form validation is implemented to ensure required fields are filled out before submission.
* **Custom Styling**: Utilizes CSS for custom styles, enhancing the form's visual appeal and user experience.

## Technologies Used
* TML5
* CSS3

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project was to revisit and apply fundamental HTML and CSS concepts after a hiatus from using these technologies. It serves not only as a refresher but also as a creative outlet to demonstrate how basic web development skills can be applied to a practical, real-world scenario like pet adoption.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the form.
3. Fill out the form to see the validation and responsive design in action.

## Future Enhancements
* Addition of more complex fields and validations.
* Implementation of a backend service to receive and store form submissions.
* Integration with a real pet adoption database to allow for live data usage.
